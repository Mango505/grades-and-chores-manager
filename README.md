A combined **Notenrechner + Taschengeld-Manager** — track school grades (Bavarian 1–6) and household chores in one place, with a shared reward wallet.

Two modes (switcher in the header):  
- **Notenrechner** — grades, weighted averages, statistics  
- **Taschengeld** — task/chore management with daily/weekly/monthly recurring tasks

Both feed into the same wallet for a unified reward system.

> **v3.0.0** adds the Taschengeld (chores) system with a mode switcher. The original grade calculator is preserved as the "Notenrechner" mode.

> **v2.0.0** replaces the CLI with a full web interface. The original CLI (`main.py`) is preserved on the `cli` branch.

## Introduction 🚀

**grades-and-chores-manager** is a self-hosted web application combining grade tracking (Notenrechner) with a chore-based allowance system (Taschengeld). Grades and chores both feed into a shared reward wallet, giving you a single place to manage school performance and household tasks.

Everything is stored locally in JSON files on the server. The web interface is a Material Design 3 SPA accessible from any browser on the same network, and is installable as a PWA on mobile.

## Features ✨

### Grades & Subjects
- Add, edit, and delete grades per subject with weighted averages
- **Labels** — tag grades (e.g. `Schulaufgabe`, `Abfrage`) for filtering
- **Chip-based multi-label filter** with AND / OR logic across all subjects
- Subject reordering, rename, and bulk delete

### Reward System
- Three reward modes: **Money (€)**, **Custom unit** (e.g. trading cards), **Points only**
- Configurable points per grade value (defaults: `1→10 pts`, `2→6 pts`, `3→2 pts`, `4–6→0`)
- Per-grade **"Belohnung buchen"** toggle — optionally skip wallet credit when adding a grade
- Wallet with running balance, redemption log, and full grade change history
- Grade change log visible even when rewards are disabled

### Statistics
- Overall and per-subject averages, best/worst subject and grade
- **Fächer & Trends** — per-subject trend direction (↑ →↓) via linear regression
- **Notenverlauf** — individual grade history + running average, rendered as inline SVG
- **Guthaben-Verlauf** — cumulative earned reward over time (when rewards enabled)
- Grade distribution bar chart, top labels, two-export comparison

### Export
- TXT export with custom label, timestamped `YYYYMMDD_HHMM`
- Configurable sections: statistics, grades per subject, grade log, redemptions
- Import two exports for side-by-side comparison (averages + subject deltas)

### Chores & Allowance
- **Two-mode switcher** — toggle between "Notenrechner" (grades) and "Taschengeld" (chores) from the header; each mode has its own navigation and pages
- **Task templates** — create recurring tasks with a name, reward amount, and period (once / daily / weekly / monthly)
- **Availability logic** — tasks show as available based on their period and `last_completed` timestamp; daily tasks reset the next day, weekly on Monday, monthly on the 1st
- **One-click completion** — completing a task credits the shared wallet immediately and logs the completion
- **Undo completion** — reverses the wallet credit and makes the task available again, restoring `last_completed` and `active` state
- **Completion history** — wallet page shows a "Taschengeld-Buchungen" section with all completed tasks and an undo button
- **Shared wallet** — grades and chores both feed into the same balance, enabling combined reward scenarios (e.g. pocket money for chores + bonus for good grades)

### App
- Responsive Material Design 3 UI — nav drawer on desktop, bottom nav + FAB on mobile
- Dark / light mode toggle (system preference + manual override)
- 8-step onboarding tour on first launch, re-triggerable from settings
- Verbose loading toggle, startup file status check
- Backup as ZIP download, old backup cleanup

## Setup ⚙️

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mango505/grades-and-chores-manager.git
cd grades-and-chores-manager
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Copy and edit the environment file:

```bash
cp _env .env
```

Key `.env` settings:

```ini
HOST=127.0.0.1      # use 0.0.0.0 to expose on your network (e.g. for mobile access)
PORT=5000
FLASK_DEBUG=1       # set to 0 in production

# Optional: point to existing CLI data files
GRADES_PATH=~/grades.json
WALLET_PATH=~/wallet.json
```

> **Note:** Always use `python app.py` to start the server — not `flask run`. The app reads `HOST` and `PORT` from `.env` via `python-dotenv`; `flask run` uses different variable names and will ignore them.

---

## Running 🚀

### Development

```bash
python app.py
# → http://localhost:5000
```

### Production (Raspberry Pi / home server)

```bash
gunicorn "app:app" --bind 0.0.0.0:5000 --workers 2
```

To keep it running permanently, use `systemd` or `screen`:

```bash
# Quick option with screen:
screen -S notenrechner
python app.py
# Ctrl+A, D to detach
```

---

## Mobile & PWA 📱

The app is installable as a Progressive Web App — it behaves like a native app with no browser chrome.

**Setup:**

1. Set `HOST=0.0.0.0` in `.env` and restart the server.
2. Find your computer's/Pi's local IP address:
   ```bash
   # macOS / Linux:
   hostname -I
   # Windows:
   ipconfig   # → IPv4 address under the Wi-Fi adapter
   ```
3. Open `http://<local-ip>:5000` on your phone (must be on the same Wi-Fi).
4. Install to home screen:
   - **iOS Safari:** Share → "Zum Home-Bildschirm"
   - **Android Chrome:** Menu → "App installieren"

The service worker caches the app shell (JS, CSS, HTML) so the UI loads even when the server is unreachable. API data (grades, wallet) is served from the last cached response when offline — writes are not possible without the server.

## Data Files 💾

All data is stored as human-readable JSON. Default locations:

| File                      | Contents                                             |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `data/grades.json`        | All subjects and their grades (value, weight, labels)|
| `data/wallet.json`        | Balance, redemption log, grade change history        |
| `data/reward_config.json` | Points map, reward mode, rate, unit name             |
| `data/app_config.json`    | File paths, verbose loading flag                     |
| `data/tasks.json`         | Tasks, completion history                            |

Paths can be overridden via `.env` — useful for pointing the web app at existing CLI data files:

```ini
GRADES_PATH=~/my_data/grades.json
WALLET_PATH=~/my_data/wallet.json
```

---

## Backup & Reset 🔄

Both are accessible from **Settings → Backup & Reset**:

- **Backup** — downloads all five data files as a single ZIP (`noten_taschengeld_backup_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.zip`)
- **Alte Backups löschen** — keeps only the most recent backup folder, deletes the rest (`data/backups/)

Individual reset actions (each requires confirmation):

| Action                        | Effect                                    |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Notenänderungen-Log leeren    | Clears grade change history               |
| Einlösungen-Log leeren        | Clears redemption log (balance unchanged) |
| Guthaben zurücksetzen         | Sets wallet balance to 0                  |
| Belohnungskonfiguration reset | Restores default points map and mode      |
| App-Konfiguration reset       | Restores default file paths               |
| Aufgaben-Log leeren           | Clears completion log (balance unchanged) |
| Aufgaben-Vorlagen reset       | Clears all task templates                 |

> ⚠️ Grade and subject deletion from the overview is permanent outside of a backup restore.

---

## CLI Legacy 🖥️

The original command-line interface is available on the `cli` branch:

```bash
git checkout cli
python main.py
```

The CLI and web app share the same data format — you can switch between them by pointing both at the same JSON files.

> **Note:** The CLI doesn't have a chores system and thus doesn't need a `tasks.json` file
